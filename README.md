# ASP.NET Core MVC Template

This will be a general purpose template for starting ASP.NET Core MVC projects.

## Packages

### User Secrets

User secrets will be used to store database configuration.

    ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection
    User ID=username;Password=secretpassword;Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=dbname;Pooling=true;

## Renaming Solution

Some files and namespaces within files will need to be renamed.

* From the root, `CustomAuth.sln` should be renamed and any usage of `CustomAuth` within the file should be replaced.
* There are file paths to be renamed in `.vs/restore.dg`, but I'm not sure if this is necessary since it is not checked in to git.
* In the project files, anywhere the `CustomAuthWeb` namespace is used, rename it.
* Rename the `.xproj` file and the `RootNamespace` element in that file.
* References for the test project will need to be renamed.
* Rename the repository in `.git/config` so changes don't get accidentally pushed to the main template.
